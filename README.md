# hello-world-forum
"Hello-World" online forum is a side project for studying web development. In this project, we used Flask for the back-end, Bootstrap for the front-end, and SQLAlchemy and SQLite for the database. We developed a posts system, CRUD system, image uploading system, and user system for a fully functional online forum.
